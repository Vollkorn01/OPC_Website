      <h2>June 2019</h2>
      <p>
        A lot has happened since the start of the year! We employed five more
        locals (managers and workers) and started living on the land. Besides
        expanding the beautiful organic garden, we started fungiculture and
        beekeeping, and diversified the oil plam monoculture into a densely
        planted dynamic agroforestry system. We also constructed a beautiful
        wooden platform and a huge and solid access road! After that we were
        ready to pull the container we shipped from Switzerland to the top of
        the land. It contained a tractor, agricultural machines, a Toyota Hilux
        and a lot of other useful things! Another milestone was the drilling of
        the well; we now get rock-fresh drinking water from 40m depth to quench
        the thirst of humans, animal and plants. Finally, we worked on our
        office building and conducted an MSc thesis about social indicators to
        create a baseline for measureing our progrss. Back in Switzerland we
        already started preparing for shipping the next container with the
        purchase of a Mercedes Benz transporter. If we will be able to maintain
        this pace, we will have a fuctioning center where we can live, learn and
        teach very soon! Thank you all so much for your hard work and
        dedication!

      <p>
        From 01 November 2018, we appointed the agricultural expert Moses
        Awiagah as our new Principal Farm Manager at OPC, Akwaaba! Since the
        agricultural component of OPC is now starting to take off due to the
        kind help of our interns Delphine Piccot and Pablo Bovy, Moses will make
        sure that we maintain and enlarge our garden and the oil palm
        agroforestry system at Busua. Furthermore, he will oversee operations of
        a larger project of mechanized arable food production in the Volta
        Region (near his hometown) that we will kick-start in 2019 with the
        shipment of a container with a tractor and agricultural machines from
        Switzerland. We are planting seeds, so we are excited to see them sprout
        in 2019 and beyond!

      <h2>August 2018</h2>
      <p>
        Since August 20th, we can count on the help of our two new volunteers
        Delphine and Pablo. They are both master students at ETH Zurich in
        Switzerland, Delphine in environmental science while Pablo is studying
        agronomic sciences. Arrived on site with lots of energy and ideas, they
        are warmly welcomed at OPC! They will stay in Busua until mid-December.
        By collaborating with members of OPC Ghana, their first objectives are
        as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Establish a productive vegetable garden
          </li>
          <li>
            Set up cultivation trials to develop a production schedule and
            optimize the use of biodynamic preparations for the regulation of
            diseases and pests
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop and implement a drip irrigation system for the garden
          </li>
          <li>
            Study soils and their fertility in order to develop suitable and
            sustainable practices that guarantee a water and nutrient supply for
            plants
          </li>
          <li>
            Terrass and improve areas in order to make vegetable production
            possible
          </li>
          <li>
            Conceptualize and build the first permanent structures

        This summer, we were honoured to host our first surfing guests, the
        Swiss couple Thomas Zraggen and Susanne Mailand. They enjoyed Ghana’s
        beautiful coastline and surfed the waves at the most beautiful and
        sometimes hard-to-access beaches (see picture J). Let’s ride the wave of
        life, for we can never be sure how long we still have it. Y’eadse

        The Swiss-based band “Trottaband” recorded the track “Obrobibini” in a
        professional studio in Zurich. OPC president Dr Christian Andres wrote
        the song back in 2017 during a one-week rehearsal retreat of the
        Trottaband in Barcelona. The song tells of the meaning of life, seeking
        for inner peace and happiness, and explains how we can accomplish this
        goal gradually through a sincere and pure spiritual practice. Listen to
        the song here:

        Ghanaian national Moses Awiagah is an agricultural expert. After having
        aspired for a long time to travel to Busua from far-off Kue (near
        Nkwanta, Northern Volta Region), he finally made his first trip all the
        way from the border of Togo to Busua. OPC welcomed him well, and in
        return received precious extension advice on how to grow our crops
        properly. More good thing to come, let’s grow this organic food in 2018
        and beyond!

      <p>
        Swiss national and MSc student of OPC Switzerland’s President Katja
        Degonda is fascinated by biochar (charcoal used as a soil amendment). It
        is a great resource for organic farming, acting like a sponge in the
        soil, which enhances its capacity to store and release both water and
        nutrients for plant growth. Katja constructed a biochar production
        facility on our farm by using two old oil barrels, that’s creativity
        combined with pragmatism at work! Our farming activities will for sure
        sustainably benefit from her intervention. Y’edase paaaaaaaaa (we thank
        you very much)!
